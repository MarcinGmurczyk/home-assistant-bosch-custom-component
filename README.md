Always attach debugscan if you have any troubles or something is missing.
To make debugscan go to HA developer tools -> Services and choose

## Home Assistant debugging log

In case of a working integration within Home Assistant you may find issues in the way the Bosch environment is visible within HA. To identify the root cause, a debug log is helpful. To obtain these log, please follow the guidenance in the wiki https://github.com/bosch-thermostat/home-assistant-bosch-custom-component/wiki/Home-Assistant-Obtain-Debug-Logs.

Example logger config for debugging:

```
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.bosch: debug
    bosch_thermostat_client: debug
```

## Bosch system scan via raw scan

The integration allows a raw scan of the connected Bosch devices via Home Assistant or Linux system. This is useful, if your installation fails or does not show devices or sensors you know to be existing.

Detailed guidance can be found at https://github.com/bosch-thermostat/home-assistant-bosch-custom-component/wiki/Trace-File-of-Communication-with-Bosch-Device-(Dev-Raw-Scan)

**bosch.debug_scan** .

Download `json` file and attach it somewhere. The `json` file is stored under <hass-config>/www/bosch_scan.json. Please make sure the www folder exists prior to running the scan.
